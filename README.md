# BioEXG Revision 1 - Assembly source code for the STM32F4 ARM Cortex M4F Microcontroller
This is the firmware for the 1st Revision of the EEG BCI Project Attempt. It establishes SPI communication with TI ADS1256 24 bit ADC and transmits integer data through UART.

*It was entirely programmed in ARM Assembly. Big mistake. Trust me.*
